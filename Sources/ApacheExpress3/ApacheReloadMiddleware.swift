/**
 * A simple middleware which simply sends the `SIGHUP` signal to the Apache
 * master process.
 * This tells Apache to perform a graceful restart. That is the configuration
 * and modules are reloaded, but the child processes are allowed to finish up
 * the connections they are currently processing.
 *
 * By default this middleware is restricted to the `development` environment
 * for hopefully obvious reasons :->
 *
 * Note: This does NOT work for an Apache instance run from within Xcode.
 *       This is because our Xcode configs start Apache in debug mode (`-X`),
 *       which means it doesn't fork.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Be careful w/ using that extension. It is best to turn in off
 *            completely in deployments.
